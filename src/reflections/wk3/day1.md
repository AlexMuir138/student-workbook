What problem does using exports solve?

They help you write code in your module and only expose those parts of your code that should only be accessed by other parts of your code.

How does export differ from export default?

With export you have do each module individually whereas export default will pull all of your modules in that js file.

What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Code can be split into smaller files for easier reading. It becomes easier to debug because you don't have to guess as much as to where the problems are. Naming conventions won't clash anymore because different files can have different names. Overall its just a better way to organize your code.
