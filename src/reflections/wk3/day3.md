What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

You can use get and set operations.

What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?

You have to write a trap for it by handing in the obj and prop elements into the paremeters.

What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

The benefit that I take away from the reading is that you can set traps for malicious or ignorant users so they can't access certain properties that you don't want them to.
