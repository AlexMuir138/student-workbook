Journal 48

This course was the hardest thing I have ever done in my educational experience. Hands down. The final was given to us and I for once didn't feel an overwhelming sense of burden. This felt accomplishable. Hard, but accomplishable. I will be biding my time wisely with this project and how it turns out will be questionable. I want funcionality over glamour this time, but I plan to do it all.
