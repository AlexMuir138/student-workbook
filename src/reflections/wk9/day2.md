What is a List in C#?

It's a basic list that can containt any data type such as reference or value.

What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

List.Find, List.Remove, List.Insert, List.sort. Seems like the most basic ones that I will end up using for editing purposes.

How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

List.find and you could use more words to get more specific results like index, last, etc.
