What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Strongly typed constants. They were used in the PizzaShack tutorial and it worked perfectly for the size prices of the pizzas.

How can you modify an Enum?

Very easily actually since it is just a collection of data and it can be edited like any other array, object, or dictionary.

How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I could have stored the rock, paper, scissors attributes into an enum, but I wasn't super savvy on them quite yet. I could have also used them on any of the projects that had pricing or attributes that never needed changing.
