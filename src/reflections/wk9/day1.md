What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value, Reference, and Pointer types. Value types are data that can't be altered. It exists in its own memory space. Reference types doesn't exist in it's own memory and gives an address to the variable. A Pointer type takes the value of another variable.

What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
bool
 byte
 char
 decimal
 double
 enum
 float
 int
 long
 sbyte
 short
 struct
 uint
 ulong
 ushort

There is just a lot of new naming conventions especially for integers. For the most part they are easy enough to understand though. 


In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Yes, they become more of a dynamic variable because they get stored once and then you just need the reference for it. Value types are similar but their data can't be redfined.
