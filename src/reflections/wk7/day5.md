This week felt more like what programming will end up being in a professional environment. We had partners, we had resources if needed, and we had a good amount of time to get things done. Last weeks project was far too much for one person in one weekend. I struggled with it a lot. The lectures this week were all kind of pointless as well with all of the errors with updating auth0 stuff and the fact that we didn't really need to see the content to implement it. We shall see how this next project turns out.
