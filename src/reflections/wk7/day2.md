What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

How to guides for the code, README files, and code documentations in the source material

What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

You can help yourself and your colleagues understand how to use the software you wrote. You can make templates with instructions and make them as referances. Basically you can make cheat sheets.

How important is Code documentation and why?

It can have its importance, but it can also be very redundant. You can easily remind yourself or inform coleagues of techniques or you can bog down your code with text that doesn't get a second thought. It's kind of here and there.
