What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A psuedo class is a keyword that you can add to a selector. The most common one being :root. Other important ones will be :first-child :only-child.

What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

It is a rule built into CSS to determine which rule to assign to an element by giving it numerical value. Example being tagNames get 1 point and classes (.) are worth 10. You can use it to override certain rules to make certain elements more more prominent like color overrides.

What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

If you add !important more than once in your style sheet you may get errors since they don't receive a numerical value and both are trying to compete. It is better to assign numerical values through specificity and scarcely use the !important property.
