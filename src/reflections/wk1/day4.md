What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wire framing is specifically for the designer to visualize their page and edit it with an interactive paint tool. You can get your boxes and buuttons where you want, find out what colors will look the best, and figure out what text you want. You can also try and visualize how you want the user to navigat by mapping pages together. It's a really useful tool.

What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There is low, mid, and high fidelity wireframes. Low-fidelity wireframes are your basic conepts that tend to be just drawings of your site and it's useful because you can visualize everything before you even need to touch a computer. Mid-level wireframes are the basic outlines of your concept as you start planning it out on a screen. They tend to be pretty raw and just get your ideas onto an editing screen with very basic functionality. They tend to not have images or text yet either. Basically this is most useful for mapping out where you want things to be. High-fidelity  wireframing is when you put the details into things. It's where you get specific with colors, fonts, image sizes, etc. It's the most useful because it can also be translated later into code very easily if you do it correctly. So all of these layers are useful, especially if you don't know where to start.

Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yes, absolutely. I may not be the most gifted person at designing a website, but if I were trying to conceptualize I would definitely start with wire-framing. You have to know your blue-print before you build your house. So this is a good way to know that you like where everything is and how it funtions before you even start touching your code.
