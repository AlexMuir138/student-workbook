What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

I think some of my favorite tips are the contrast between text colors to make them pop and configuring box shadows to get those cards and sections to stand out. I also, for some reason, really like the concept of accent borders. They really are very simple but ad a lot to the page.

Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

At the moment I only know of bootstrap as a resource for good design ideas. There are a lot of basic formats for text and layouts on there that I can pull from to make my page more attractive. If I were to draw from websites I would definitely take a look at Amazon and Facebook. Those two sites are still popular today because of their design and ease to the users.

How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Design is everything to the user. The better designed your page is the more you can pull people's eyes where you want them. You put the imporant text front and center and in tones that magnetize the user's gaze as well as use good color to make it easier to look at. A good design could mean the difference between a company making money or none at all.
