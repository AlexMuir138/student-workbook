What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?

A pyramid shape in the code and a lot of curly brackets followed by regular brackets '})'

What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

It means essentially "take some time" or "happens in the future, not right now"

Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell

Keep your code shallow- Name everything so it is easier to callback to them.
Modularize- take your functions and seperate them into their own modules.
Handle every single error- Self-explanatory. Check the errors and know what they mean so you know where to look.
