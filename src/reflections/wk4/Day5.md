Journal 19


This week was also a tough one. With not a firm grasp on either JS or the MVC pattern we moved into more advanced stuff which led me to really bury myself in the afternoon challenges to get them done. It was not easy and took most of my weekend to figure out the inner workings of the API MVC project. This course is challenging to say the least. I'm enjoying a lot of the struggles, but as soon as I figure one out there tends to be a heaping pile put back onto my shoulders. It is very difficuly to breathe a sigh of relief in this course.
