What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing, Component Testing, and End to End testing. Unit testing tests isolated code, Component testing tests components made in the vue frame work, and end to end testing tests what the user will actually do with your application.

What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

End to end testing would probably have the most importance. Sure you want to get your functionality correct, but what you really need know is what could go wrong when your user is navigating.

What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Probably the components testing because it is very apparent when you run your application if the components aren't functional and it can also be solved with unit testing.
