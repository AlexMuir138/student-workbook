What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

It shows that you know your craft to employers. It shows your personal brand. It also sets you apart from your peers.

What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

What you choose to put in it. Depending on languages and app design it is helpful to put in apps that show you have technical knowhow. Weather apps, financial apps, organizational apps are all good ones to start with.

What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

The checkpoint projects were all designed to be portfolio pieces for students as well as some of the afternoon projects. The capstones, granted they are appropriate for work, are also good pieces to include. They show that I can learn different languages and functions.
