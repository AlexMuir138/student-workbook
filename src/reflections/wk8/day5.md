Journal 39

This has been an interesting week for sure. Coming out of the gauntlet was no easy feat for me and going straight into a capstone is a huge endeavour especially when your team is sort of hodge podged together. We have a good idea and a decent team though. I fear that I will lose a foothold on a lot of things before we go back into learning new languages though. So the challenge will be in staying sharp, even though I only consider myself butter knife sharp at this so far.
