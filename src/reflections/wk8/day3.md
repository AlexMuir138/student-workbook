What is Software Development Testing?

It is the testing of smallest units of code. Basically it is testing for bugs before deployment. It is often the hardest part to get right.

What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

You can tell what is working and what is not working. It gives you more efficient code and peace of mind. It can also give you a sense of what to do in future projects to make sure that you stay ahead of errors.

What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

There is a drive to make things simpler rather than challenging your team to push for better solutions. It can also be what holds up the team the most rather than moving forward.
