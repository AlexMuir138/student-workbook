Why is communication on a small team important?

The better question is why it wouldn't be? If the team doesn't communicate then there is no progress. There would be nothing but merge conflicts, rabbit holes followed, functionality problems, database problems, and that would lead to conflict between team members.

What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Hardly any really. Stand ups, code reviews, prep work, scrum boards are all as effective in these smaller groups as they are in larger ones. You just have to dial in the when, who, and whats of the group.

What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The levels of service provided by devs in terms of time and money. Good service Cheap won't be Fast. Good service Fast won't be Cheap. Fast service Cheap won't be Good.
