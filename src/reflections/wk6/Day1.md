What is Component based architecture?

It is a framework for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface into self-sustaining, independent micro-systems

What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

It allows you to compartmentalize your data on the screen. It gives you cleaner code to work with and it also allows it to run faster because of your encapsulation processes. It also allows you to debug faster and know where your problems are. You can also see the DOM update almost live which is very useful.

What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

Readability might be compromised for functionality. This framework should not be used in every aspect of your application. It was designed to be "sprinkled" into your application.
