What is a nested route?

It nests components inside eachother to allow for a more complex useer interface.

When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

When we have a lot of information about different topics and you only want to access a certain amount of them. It's sort of like dictionaries but more complex. They can be really useful at creating very specific routes within your framework if you lay the wires out correctly.

Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes. When you need to call specific paremeters for specific functions.
