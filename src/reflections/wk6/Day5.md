This week had it's ups and downs. It is starting to feel like this course is making a little more sense however it is nonetheless challenging. The thing that I find particularly annoying as of late is that class has consistently started almost no earlier than 9:30. Even when the class starts its usually almost 30 minutes of going over the morning challenges. So the first hours of class are a waste of time. Then we ease into the material and when 11:00 hits its a mad dash before sending us to lunch usually 20-30 mins over noon. It's frustrating because I am barely grasping certain things and an extra hour of lecture would work wonders.
