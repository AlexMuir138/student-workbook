What are the three types of relationships?

One to One, One to Many, Many to Many.

What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding

You can link a lot of seperate information together with a few different functions and follow a sort of family tree style where you don't have to take as much time to embed.

What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
