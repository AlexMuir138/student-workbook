In simple terms what is a sub-document?

Documents nested in other documents.

When might you use a sub-document?

When your parent schemas need subSchemas. Example being the Ryu moves. Making Schemas for his moves list would be helpful.

How do you add to a collection of sub-documents? What about editing them?

You can add an array of objects inside the object itself or you can add to it later with the ryu example again being ryu.specials.
