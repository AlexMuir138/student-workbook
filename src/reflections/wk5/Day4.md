What is a virtual property?

They are additional fields for a given model.

When might you use a virtual property?

When you want to add properties to an already existing property such as additional naming conventions. Adding a last name is the example with concatenation.

How do you search by a virtual properties value?

You can't. You would have to search for the orgininal non-virtual properties in order to get them back.
