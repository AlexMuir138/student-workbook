Journal 24

This week was a little easier knowing there was no checkpoint and also that it was shorter. However the content was so compacted that I did not get enough practice with all of the database frameworks. I got to write the code just fine, but getting it  connected was my biggest issue. Hopefully I am able to get more practice next week because I always feel like I am one week behind on practicing with these methods. At the moment I have a small grasp on a lot of very big concepts.
