What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

// Function Declarations

function name(parameters) {
    // statements
}

// Function Expressions//

let name = function(parameters) {
    // statements
}

// Arrow Function Expression//

let name = (parameters) => {
    // statements
}

Function Declarations are hoisted so they can be used before they are defined. Function Expressions and Arrow Function Expressions are not hoisted so they have to be defined before they are used.

What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are the names of the functions whereas the Arguments are the values that the function recieves when it is invoked.


What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

A higher order function is when a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function.
