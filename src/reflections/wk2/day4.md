What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Speaking from experience, so far, making a plan is essential. From the reading over the workbook i really related to the waterfall effect where I try and tackle everything at once. I need to stop doing this and take a more simplistic approach because when I break it down into bite sized pieces I am much more at ease.

How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Google is probably the greatest resource for when you don't have a team of people helping you. If you do, use the people around you that know more. Most people want to help you solve the issues without making you feel inferior. Usually they were at your level before and want to see you succeed as well.

From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Make plans before you start, ask for help or google things before you quit, organize and clean your code up so its readable, and basically don't be afraid to fail and fail often.
