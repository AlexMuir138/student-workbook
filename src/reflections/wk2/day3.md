What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

You can open the console, the elements panel, or the panel that you were using last. You should have the console open at all times to make sure your code is behaving the way you want it to. You can open the last one you were using to see the problem you just ran into. Lastly, the elements panel will show you all of the HTML/CSS to manipulate and fix if needed.

You can add elements, debug, manipulate the DOM, test out code live, and a lot more through these tabs. They are very useful and most of the time they are best used to make sure that your code is running smoothly at all times and if it's not it will tell you why not.

Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab. You can see all of the classes and ids associated with the DOM as well as manipulate them to see how they will behave in a live format. You will also see color coded areas that define margin and padding which is very helpful in building your page.

Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

You can use break points in your code which will pause on that line so that you can slow down your computer and see what the problem is. You can use the devtools to go through line by line and see what's broken.
